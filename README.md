# Retrieval Augmented Generation
### You probably have heard of "RAG" by now, but..
..Most sources you find online are either too complex or too simple, or they don't provide a complete picture of how to implement RAG effectively.

This repo aims to provide various ways to implement RAG, including: 
   - EasyRAG : A web-app utilizing [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/document-processing?lang=python) with ready-to-use RAG. The most efficient and accurate one. 
   - MediRAG : A CLI app utilizing [LangChian](https://www.langchain.com/), A tool which is someone's first thought when the hear "RAG"
   - HardRAG : RAG using minimal set of tools. Although still relying on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)/[Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) to put the 'G' in RAG.
   - ScratchRAG : Retrival, Augmentation, Generation from low level tools - numpy and pytorch, in code, spelled out.
